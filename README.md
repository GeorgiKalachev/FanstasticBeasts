This application simulates the work of a fantasy animal amusement park. The park has various attractions, and each attraction contains a type of animal, a crown number, and a price. The price depends on the animal and its crown number.

There are three types of animals in the park: aquatic, aerial, and terrestrial, each with its own unique characteristics. Customers can come to the park, and each customer has a name, age, and payment category that determines what attractions they can visit and how much they must pay. The purpose of visiting an attraction is to experience the animal's unique crown number, and this experience can vary depending on the animal.

However, extreme attractions come with a 10% risk that things may not end well for the customer, and the animal may "swallow" them. This simulator keeps track of the number of customers who were not able to return from the park, the number of people taken by the devil, the names of all pensioners burned by dragons, and the average age of all park customers.
